# Changelog

## 1.0.8

### Fixed
- The package installs again. Unused dependencies (`nesbot/carbon`, `clue/buzz-react`, `doctrine/instantiator`, `symfony/finder`, `react/event-loop`) are gone; Composer was refusing every earlier release because of a security advisory on the pinned Carbon version.
- `composer.json` now carries the Packagist name, `oguzhantogay/philips-hue-client`.
- Effects (`ColorLoop`, `Breathing`, `Alert`) no longer fail to load: their `start()` and `stop()` signatures conflicted with `BaseEffect`.
- REST API: setting hue/saturation and renaming a light called methods that did not exist. Added `Light::setName()`.

### Removed
- `RetryHandler::executeAsync()`, which nothing called and which depended on the removed ReactPHP packages.
